# Lecture 1.2: Tools
We choose the Linux operating system as the programming platform,
the Github website as the place to put your code,
the Julia language as the programming language for implementing algorithms, VSCode as the Julia language editor and Pluto notebooks as the slides for the course.

## A cheatsheet for Linux operating system
We use `man command_name` to get help information related to a certain command.
Use `CTRL-C` to exit any program. Use `CTRL-D` to exit a shell, an REPL and other input streams. The following is a cheatsheet for commands that used in this course.

```
ls      # list directory contents
cd      # change directory
mkdir   # make directories
rm      # remove files or directories
pwd     # print name of current/working directory

alias   # create an alias for a command

lscpu   # display information about the CPU architecture
lsmem   # list the ranges of available memory with their online status

top     # display Linux processes
ssh     # the OpenSSH remote login client
vim     # Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor
git     # the stupid content tracker
```

### SSH
Connect to the AWS host for this course.

### Vim editor
```
i       # input
:w      # write
:q      # quit
:q!     # force quit without saving

u       # undo
CTRL-R  # redo
```
All the commands must be executed in the command mode (the default mode when you start a vim editor),
If you are currently in the input mode, you can alway type `ESC` to go back to the command mode.

## A cheatsheet for Git and Github
There are more than 100 git sub-commands, and the following is a short list to practise and keep in mind.
```
# global config
git config  # Get and set repository or global options

# initialize a repo
git init    # Create an empty Git repo or reinitialize an existing one
git clone   # Clone repository into new directory

# info
git status  # Show the working tree status
git log     # Show commit logs
git diff    # Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

# work on a branch
git add     # Add file contents to the index
git rm      # Remove files from the working tree and from the index
git commit  # Record changes to the repository
git reset   # Reset current HEAD to the specified state

# branch manipulation
git checkout # Switch branches or restore working tree files
git branch  # List, create, or delete branches
git merge   # Join two or more development histories together

# remote synchronization
git remote  # Manage set of tracked repositories
git pull  # Fetch from and integrate with another repo or a local branch
git fetch   # Download objects and refs from another repository
git push    # Update remote refs along with associated objects
```
### Examples
1. create a new git repo and make your first commit
Go to the folder that you want to create a git repo from and type
```
git init     # will create a `.git` folder under the current directory.
git add -A   # add all files to git
git commit -m 'some description about the change'
```
Here we have used `-A` to add/remove file automatically instead of adding the files one by one.
You might want to edit the `.gitignore` file to avoid adding garbage files to the commit history by accident.
The following is a typical .gitignore file for a Julia package
```
.DS_Store
.vscode
*.swp

*.jl.*.cov
*.jl.cov
*.jl.mem

Manifest.toml

/docs/build/
/docs/Manifest.toml
```
All files matching the above patterns will be ignored by `git add -A`.

2. upload your local repository to Github
Open your Github homepage, click new repository.
(check)
Please do not need to choose adding README or LICESE if you are creating a Julia package, because the `PkgTemplates` will generate one for you.
Then you will see a detailed instruction, just follow the instruction.

3. making a **pull request**
*pull request* means proposing a change to a repository that you may or may not have the edit permission.

To start making a pull request, you should find the Github repo, click the `fork` icon at the top right of the webpage. A copy of the Github repo will be created under your own account so that you can edit it freely.
```
git clone https://github.com/my-github-name/ModernScientificComputing
git checkout -b my-own-branch-name  # create a new branch
# make some edits ...
git push origin   # will upload the edits to your github repository
```
Go to the forked repository under your own account, you will see a button showing up to suggest you making a pull request, just following the guide.
If you did not see the button poping up, which happens if your edit is old than several hours, you can also go to the pull request page to create a pull request from there.

### Using VSCode
### Using Pluto notebooks
To open a pluto notebook, you should have `Pluto` package installed in your global environment by typing in the Pkg mode
```julia
pkg> add Pluto
```

Copy-pasting the following command to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file enables you to open a pluto notebook from a Linux shell.
```bash
alias pluto='julia -e "using Pluto
if length(ARGS) > 0
    notebook = ARGS[1]
    Pluto.run(notebook=joinpath(pwd(), notebook))
else
    Pluto.run()
end"'
```

To open a Pluto notebook in your browser, please open a new shell and type `pluto path/to/pluto/file`.
If the path is not provided, the command will open a the Pluto start up page in your browser.
