title: Setup your Jekyll on Github pages
---
1. Fork this [repo](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/giggleliu.github.io), rename it to `<your-github-username>.github.io` (`settings` tab on repository page).
2. Once you have cloned your own web project, you can change site-name/email/backgroup/avatar et. al.,
      * place images under `images/` folder
      * edit `_config.yml` to change avatar/site-name/avatar and more, see comments inside.
      * edit `style.scss` to change background image.
      * edit `about.html` to match your personal information.
3. add posts, see the demo post under `_posts` folder.

**The following line is a test for math rendering**

Jekyll is perfect if math $\|\langle\psi\vert\psi\rangle\|^2$ is rendered else sucks!

Here the vertical line must be written as `\vert` instead of `|`,
