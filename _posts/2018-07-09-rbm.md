# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for Physicsts

## Data: Motivation

Given an i.i.d dataset $\mathcal D$ that drawn from a target probability distribution $\pi(x)$, with $x$ an input vector (or image).

We want to learn a model $p_\theta(x)\sim \pi(x)$.

Here $\mathcal D$ can be

* an image dataset,
* monte carlo samples,
* measurement results of a quantum circuit.

## Model: What is a Boltzmann Machine?

An energy based model to describe probability distribution

$p_\theta(x)=\frac{e^{-E_\theta(x)}}{Z_\theta}$, where $E_\theta(x)$ is described by a graph, $Z_\theta=\sum\limits_xe^{-E_\theta(x)}$is the partition function, $x$ is a vector consists of $x_i=0,1$, $\theta$ is the network parameters.

Typically, we can construct a Boltzmann Machine with the energy defined as

$E(x) = -\frac 1 2x_iW_{ij}x_j$

Here $W$ matrix is the $\theta$ parameters in the above formulation. It resembles the famous **Ising** model. 

## Loss: The criteria for optimization

We want to maximize the likehood

$$l = \prod\limits_yp(y)$$,

or equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood(NLL) loss

$$\begin{align}\mathcal{L}=\frac L N = \frac 1 N \sum\limits_y E(y) +\log Z\end{align}$$

## Training: How to minimize the NLL loss?

Partition function $Z$ is notoriously hard to obtain, it is one of the fundamental problem in statistic physics.

Interestingly, $\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \theta}$ can be estimated!

$$\begin{align}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\theta} &= \mathbb E_{y\in \mathcal D}[E'(y)]-\frac{\sum\limits_x E'(x)e^{-E(x)}}{Z}\\&=\mathbb E_{y\in \mathcal D}[E'(y)] - \mathbb E_{x\sim p(x)}[E'(x)]\end{align}$$

However, classical spin statistics are not simple enough, the second term is still hard.

### A energy based model suited for inference

Inference means Given part of $x$, guess the rest, it is based on conditional probability $p(x_{B}\vert x_{A}) = \sum\limits_hp(x_{B}\vert h)p(h\vert x_{A})$, which is useful in recommender systems.

However, a general energy based model is hard to make **inference**(or conditional probability), so we need a **Restricted Boltzmann Machine**

$$E(x) = x^T\mathbf Wh + b^Th +x^Ta$$

![bmrbm](Figures/Handson/rbmcompress.png)





conditional probability $p(x\vert h)\propto e^{-x^T(\mathbf Wh+a)}=\prod\limits_ie^{-x_i\Theta_i}$, where $\Theta_i$ is the ith element of $\mathbf Wh+a$.

Since all variables $x_i$ are independant from each other, we can do pixel-wise sampling according to probability $p(x_i)\propto \frac{e^{-x_i\Theta_i}}{1+e^{-x_i\Theta_i}}$  (i.e. $p(x_i=0)=\sigma(\Theta_i)$)

**Gibbs sampling:**

conditional sampling $x_1\rightarrow h_1\rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \ldots\rightarrow x_n$, will converge to $p(x)$ and $p(h)$.

1). $\frac{p(x_{t}\vert x_{t-1})}{p(x_{t-1}\vert x_t)}=\frac{p(x_t)}{p(x_{t-1})}$

$p(x_t\vert x_{t-1}) =\sum\limits_{h} p(x_t\vert h)p(h\vert x_{t-1})=\sum\limits_h\frac{p(x_t, h)p(h, x_{t-1})}{p(h)p(x_{t-1})}$

$p(x_{t-1}\vert x_{t}) =\sum\limits_{h} p(x_{t-1}\vert h)p(h\vert x_{t})=\sum\limits_h\frac{p(x_{t-1}, h)p(h, x_t)}{p(h)p(x_t)}$

Statistic ensemble $\rightarrow$ Time ensemble

2). ergodicity, obvious.

##### Gradient:

$E_\theta(x) = -x^Ta+\sum\limits_j\log(1+e^{(-x^T W+b^T)_j})$
$$
\begin{cases}\frac{\partial E\theta(x)}{\partial W{ij}} &= -x_i\sigma((-x^T W-b^T)_j)\\

\frac{\partial E\theta(x)}{\partial b{j}} &= -\sigma((-x^T W-b^T)_j)\\

\frac{\partial E_\theta(x)}{\partial a} &= -x_i^T \end{cases}
$$
Remark: usually, we don't need do this gradient stuff by hand, we have [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)!
