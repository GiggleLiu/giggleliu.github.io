Hi! I am Jinguo Liu, a computational physicist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). My dream is to simulate the world with a computer.

I am recruiting PhD students. If you can read Chinese, please check out this [blog post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/566530117) for more information. Otherwise, please contact me directly through email. If you want to learn more about my past research experience, please check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4edw228AAAAJ) and [CV](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/CV/raw/master/cv.pdf).

#### Research Interests
* Numeric methods, e.g. tensor networks, Monte Carlo, and differential programming
* Simulate quantum systems, such as Rydberg atom arrays and open quantum systems
* The Julia programming language

Please check our [group website](https://www.jinguo-group.science/) to learn more about our research.
